## Purpose

## Current Quality Gates

Run before APP implementation review:

- `npm run lint`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000 NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://example.supabase.co NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=placeholder-anon-key npm run build`
- `git diff --check`
- translation key parity check across `src/i18n/en`, `src/i18n/it`, `src/i18n/es`, `src/i18n/fr` and `src/i18n/de`

APP-007 does not run remote Supabase migrations, Docker or production deployment checks. Database behavior for RLS/RPC and Storage policies requires a real Supabase/PostgreSQL environment for execution testing.

APP-008.1 adds the `organizations.timezone` migration. Dashboard query behavior still requires a real Supabase/PostgreSQL environment with tenant data for full execution testing.

Validate dashboard “today” windows against the active organization timezone. The EcoWash default is `Atlantic/Canary`.

AUTH-001 also requires manual staging validation with Supabase Auth redirect URLs configured:

- forgot-password form sends a recovery email
- Supabase `over_email_send_rate_limit` / email rate-limit responses show a safe retry-later message
- recovery link opens `/{locale}/update-password`
- invalid or expired recovery links show a safe error
- mismatched or weak passwords are rejected
- successful update signs out the recovery session and redirects to login
- login succeeds with the new password
- no service-role key is used in browser or Server Actions

Current real-test status:

- PRODUCT-001 completed the commercial readiness and feature-gap audit.
- UX-002 completed app layout, dashboard hierarchy, order detail information architecture, mobile navigation, contrast and touch target refinements.
- UX-002.5 quality gates passed: `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, `git diff --check`.
- AUTH-001 quality gates passed.
- Password recovery E2E completed.
- Owner login and `/it/app` access completed.
- INFRA-001-SMOKE completed with `PASS WITH NON-BLOCKING ISSUES`.
- INFRA-001-SMOKE corrective work is committed at `f94df88`.
- INFRA-001.1 completed remote migration history reconciliation.
- Supabase migration history reconciled successfully on 2026-07-30.
- SEC-001 completed the Supabase security audit.
- SEC-001.1 applied database privilege, RPC and Storage policy hardening through migration `20260801000100`.
- SEC-001.2 authenticated mutation regression passed with rollback-only tests and no smoke baseline drift.

INFRA-001-SMOKE validated with real staging data:

- first customer
- first property
- first service/price
- first order
- pickup/delivery
- production transition
- payment
- photo
- populated dashboard
- logout/login persistence

Smoke checkpoints:

| Checkpoint | Area | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Login e app shell | PASS |
| 2 | Cliente | PASS |
| 3 | Proprietà | PASS |
| 4 | Servizio e prezzo | PASS |
| 5 | Ordine | PASS |
| 6 | Item e totale | PASS |
| 7 | Produzione | PASS |
| 8 | Pickup | PASS |
| 9 | Delivery | PASS |
| 10 | Payment | PASS |
| 11 | Photo | PASS |
| 12 | Dashboard | PASS |
| 13 | Logout/login | PASS |

Smoke final state:

- order `EW-000001`
- order total `25,00 EUR`
- production status `Pronto`
- pickup completed
- delivery completed
- balance zero after two payments
- one intake photo uploaded and previewed
- data persisted after logout/login

INFRA-001.1 read-only verification:

- `order-media` bucket exists
- `order-media` is private
- file size limit is 1 MB
- MIME allowlist contains JPEG, PNG and WebP
- `Cliente Smoke Test` present
- `Appartamento Smoke Test` present
- `Lavaggio e asciugatura test` present
- order `EW-000001` present
- one active order item
- order total `25,00 EUR`
- production status `Pronto`
- pickup completed
- delivery completed
- payments total `25,00 EUR`
- balance due `0,00 EUR`
- one active intake photo

Smoke bugs resolved in the corrective diff:

- BUG-001: `create_order` failed on staging due to `min(uuid)` and an ambiguous `id` reference.
- BUG-002: order list embed used an ambiguous `profiles` relationship.
- BUG-003/BUG-004: pickup and delivery embeds used ambiguous `profiles` relationships.
- BUG-005: item creation needed immediate repeated-submit protection.
- BUG-006: order item editing needed a single active edit form.

Known non-blocking gaps from the smoke run:

- Storage bucket privacy was not directly re-verified during the photo checkpoint, though the private bucket had been confirmed during INFRA-001.
- Negative MIME/size upload tests were not executed during this smoke run.
- Overpayment behavior was not documented with a definitive result.
- Payment actor visibility was not documented with a definitive result.
- Final read-only database verification via CLI completed during INFRA-001.1.
- Remote migration history is reconciled for the manually applied smoke corrective SQL.
- Staging smoke records remain present and should only be cleaned up in a separate approved task.

## SEC-001 Completed Security Verification

SEC-001 verified RLS, Storage policies, grants, RPC permissions, `security definer` functions, `search_path`, tenant helper functions and browser/server environment boundaries.

SEC-001.1 remediation result:

- anonymous RPC execution is blocked
- internal helpers such as `recalculate_order_totals(uuid)` and `app_current_organization_id()` are not client-executable
- authenticated RPCs used by the app remain explicitly allowlisted
- anonymous table SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/TRUNCATE privileges are removed
- authenticated table privileges are reduced to the operations used by the app
- `order-media` SELECT requires active `order_photos` metadata matching bucket, path, organization and order

SEC-001.2 regression result:

- authenticated rollback-only mutation tests passed for order detail, item save/remove, discount, logistics, payment, refund, void, photo registration/deactivation and status transition RPCs
- `create_order` was verified as reachable by authenticated users up to domain validation without consuming the order-number sequence
- rollback fixture data did not persist
- smoke order `EW-000001` remained unchanged

PILOT-001 must preserve these security assumptions while defining portal scope, roles, permissions, route architecture, dependencies, implementation order and acceptance criteria. It must not implement routes or UI, apply migrations, alter Supabase remote state, modify staging data, expose secrets or use service-role credentials in browser code.

## APP-007 Static Security Simulation

Expected outcomes before review:

- tenant A reads tenant B photos: DENIED
- tenant A uses tenant B order for logistics/payment/photo RPC: DENIED
- staff voids payment: DENIED
- owner voids payment with reason: ALLOWED
- refund greater than refundable amount: DENIED
- payment greater than balance due: DENIED
- duplicate payment submit that exceeds remaining balance: SAFE FAILURE
- delivery assigned to user from another tenant: DENIED
- direct payment update: DENIED
- direct manipulated photo metadata insert: DENIED
- Storage path cross-tenant upload/read: DENIED
- anonymous signed URL creation: DENIED
- expired signed URL access: SAFE FAILURE
- cancelled delivery to completed: DENIED
- completed delivery changes production: DENIED
- paid order changes production: DENIED
- photo deactivate preserves metadata: ALLOWED
- hard delete: DENIED
- inactive membership RPC: DENIED
- invalid MIME or size: DENIED
- logistics fee changes order total: DENIED, fee is informational in APP-007
- direct Storage object update/delete: DENIED
