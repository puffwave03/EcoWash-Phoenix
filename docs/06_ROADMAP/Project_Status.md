## DEV-010 Completed Work To Date

DEV-010 is the public website final audit and release-preparation phase. The following scoped follow-up missions are completed, committed and pushed:

- `DEV-010.1` fixed verified public release issues in metadata, contact-form clarity and localized content.
- `DEV-010.2` clarified SaaS preview claims and contact/demo behavior so the public site does not imply that backend, billing, payments, live data or a real submission endpoint already exist.
- `DEV-010.3` optimized homepage photographic assets to WebP and kept runtime image references aligned.
- `DEV-010.4` finalized favicon, app icons, Apple icon and Open Graph/Twitter preview assets using the EcoWash water mark.

Latest completed DEV-010 commit:

- `6ef5344 DEV-010.4 feat: replace site icons with EcoWash water mark`

Current DEV-010 state:

- Release-ready, deployment deferred.
- Lint and build have passed in the validated DEV-010 state.
- Production deployment is deferred until domain selection and purchase.
- No backend, database, authentication, Supabase or SaaS platform is implemented.
- APP-001 is approved.
- APP-002 is completed and pushed.
- APP-003 is completed and pushed.
- APP-004 is completed and pushed.
- APP-005 is completed and pushed.
- APP-006 is completed and pushed.
- APP-007 is in implementation review.
- Next step after APP-007 approval is `APP-008`.

## APP-007 Implementation State

APP-007 implements photos, pickup, delivery and manual payment foundations in implementation review:

- versioned migration for `pickups`, `deliveries`, `payments` and `order_photos`
- private Supabase Storage bucket `order-media`
- tenant-scoped Storage policies using `organization_id/order_id/random_uuid.ext`
- short-lived signed URLs generated on demand
- 1 MB JPEG/PNG/WebP upload path through Server Actions
- narrow PostgreSQL RPCs for logistics save/transition, payment record/void/refund and photo metadata registration/deactivation
- derived read-only payment summary from order total and valid payment records
- order detail sections for pickup/delivery, payments and order photos
- translation keys for English, Spanish, Italian, French and German

APP-007 keeps production, fulfillment and payment separate. `production_status = completed` still means only that production work is finished; delivery and payment can remain pending. Manual payment status is derived from confirmed and refunded payment records, void payments do not count, and overpayment is rejected for the MVP.

APP-007 does not implement analytics, push notifications, QR, OCR, fiscal invoices, PDF generation, online payment providers, customer portal, mobile app, Realtime, Edge Functions or APP-008 dashboard analytics.

Next task after APP-007 approval is `APP-008 — Dashboard and Operational Overview`.

## APP-002 Documentation State

APP-002 defined the initial order domain and database design for the future EcoWash MVP. It documents:

- organization-scoped, multi-tenant-ready data ownership
- owner, manager and staff roles for the MVP
- customers, properties, services, prices, orders and order items
- separated production, fulfillment, payment and issue models
- optional pickup and delivery per order
- manual payments and derived payment state
- order photos and private storage ownership principles
- RLS strategy and APP-003 security invariants
- audit log boundaries

APP-002 did not implement code, migrations, Supabase configuration, authentication, database tables or a SaaS dashboard.

## APP-003 Implementation State

APP-003 implements the Supabase tenant foundation only:

- versioned Supabase local configuration
- environment variables for Supabase URL and anon key
- browser and server Supabase client factories
- PostgreSQL tenant root table `organizations`
- operating site table `locations`
- application profile table `profiles`
- organization membership table `organization_memberships`
- MVP role enum for `owner`, `manager` and `staff`
- PostgreSQL helper functions for membership and role checks
- initial RLS policies for foundation tables

APP-003 does not implement login UI, signup UI, reset password, protected dashboard, customers, properties, services, orders, order items, payments, order photos, operational Storage buckets, pickup/delivery, notifications, OCR, PDF, Realtime, Edge Functions, customer portal or mobile app.

## APP-004 Implementation State

APP-004 implements authentication and role guards only:

- localized login route
- email/password login through Supabase SSR

- manual first-owner bootstrap documentation

APP-004 does not implement public signup, reset password, magic link, OAuth, MFA, customers, properties, services, orders, payments, order photos, pickup/delivery, Realtime, Edge Functions, customer portal or mobile app.

## APP-005 Implementation State

APP-005 implements the customers and properties module only:

- versioned migration for `customers` and `properties`

- property type enum for `apartment`, `holiday_home`, `hotel`, `business` and `other`
- tenant-scoped customer and property tables with RLS
- composite property/customer tenant foreign key

APP-005 does not implement services, pricing, orders, order items, payments, order photos, operational Storage buckets, pickup/delivery, notifications, OCR, PDF, Realtime, Edge Functions, customer portal or mobile app.

## APP-006 Implementation State

APP-006 implements orders and production workflow only:

- versioned migration for `services`, `service_prices`, `orders`, `order_items` and `order_status_history`
- service unit types for weight and piece services
- standard service pricing with order item snapshots
- server-side order number generation
- atomic RPCs for order creation, item mutation, discount update and production status transitions
- append-only production status history
- protected services and orders dashboard routes

## Final Homepage Image Assets

The approved homepage image set is present, integrated and committed at these final paths:

Hero:

- `public/images/home/hero/industrial-laundry-background.webp`
- `public/images/home/hero/folded-white-linen.webp`
- `public/images/home/hero/folded-green-textiles.webp`

Services:

- `public/images/home/services/industrial-laundry.webp`
- `public/images/home/services/dry-cleaning.webp`
- `public/images/home/services/ironing-finishing.webp`

Industries:

- `public/images/home/industries/hotel-resort.webp`
- `public/images/home/industries/vacation-rental.webp`
- `public/images/home/industries/professional-laundry.webp`

Final CTA:

- `public/images/home/cta/green-linen-texture.webp`

These assets are real non-empty WebP files. They are integrated through Next.js Image with preserved aspect ratios. Decorative Hero imagery uses empty alt text. Services and Industries imagery uses translated alt text. Crop and object-position choices are deliberate for desktop, tablet and mobile layouts. Placeholder SVGs are not used as visible replacements where final photographic assets exist.

## Current Brand and Social Assets

The current site icon and social-preview set is committed at:

- `public/brand/ecowash-logo.png` — official full EcoWash logo used in Header, Footer and DashboardPreview
- `public/brand/ecowash-product-mark.svg` — master vector water mark for favicon/app/social assets
- `src/app/favicon.ico` — multi-size favicon
- `src/app/icon.png` — 512x512 site icon
- `src/app/apple-icon.png` — 180x180 Apple touch icon
- `public/social/ecowash-og.png` — 1200x630 Open Graph and Twitter preview image

The DEV-010.4 mark follows the Product Owner reference direction: green side form, blue central drop, blue lower wave and three bubbles. It does not use the old "EcoWash La Tejita" lockup, the old URL, or embedded raster artwork. Metadata paths are configured and verified for `/favicon.ico`, `/icon.png`, `/apple-icon.png` and `/social/ecowash-og.png`.
