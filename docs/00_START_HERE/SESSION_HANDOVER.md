## Supabase Staging State

Completed on EcoWash Staging:

- Supabase Staging is connected.
- `.env.local` is configured locally and ignored by Git.
- Approved migrations through APP-008.1 were applied before smoke testing.
- First owner Auth user, profile, organization, location and owner membership exist.
- Password recovery E2E completed.
- Owner login completed.
- Real dashboard visible at `/it/app`.
- UX-001 protected app shell completed.
- INFRA-001-SMOKE completed end to end.
- INFRA-001.1 completed.
- Supabase migration history reconciled successfully on 2026-07-30.
- `order-media` bucket verified as private with 1 MB image limit and JPEG/PNG/WebP allowlist.
- SEC-001.1 remediation migration `20260801000100_sec_001_1_security_remediation.sql` is applied and local/remote migration history is aligned.
- SEC-001.2 authenticated mutation regression passed with rollback-only test coverage and no smoke baseline drift.

Applied baseline migrations:

- `20260727000100_app_003_tenant_foundation.sql`
- `20260728000100_app_005_customers_properties.sql`
- `20260728000200_app_006_orders_workflow.sql`
- `20260728000300_app_007_logistics_photos_payments.sql`
- `20260728000400_app_008_1_organization_timezone.sql`

Smoke corrective migration:

- `20260730000100_infra_001_smoke_fix_order_helper_and_embeds.sql`

Security remediation migration:

- `20260801000100_sec_001_1_security_remediation.sql`

## Migration History State

Supabase migration history reconciled successfully on 2026-07-30.

During INFRA-001-SMOKE, the corrective SQL for `app_current_organization_id()` and `create_order()` was applied manually in EcoWash Staging through SQL Editor so the smoke test could continue. INFRA-001.1 reconciled the remote migration history so local and remote now both include `20260730000100`.

Do not rerun the corrective migration. Do not use `supabase db reset --linked`, `supabase migration up`, or `supabase db push` unless a future task explicitly approves it.

SEC-001.1 added database privilege hardening, explicit authenticated RPC allowlisting, `recalculate_order_totals(uuid)` client execution revocation, table privilege reduction and active-metadata enforcement for `order-media` SELECT. SEC-001.2 verified rollback-only authenticated mutation regression with no persistent data changes.

## INFRA-001-SMOKE Result

Final result:

`PASS WITH NON-BLOCKING ISSUES`

Validated checkpoints:

| Checkpoint | Area | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Login e app shell | PASS |
| 2 | Cliente | PASS |
| 3 | Proprietà | PASS |
| 4 | Servizio e prezzo | PASS |
| 5 | Ordine | PASS |
| 6 | Item e totale | PASS |
| 7 | Produzione | PASS |
| 8 | Pickup | PASS |
| 9 | Delivery | PASS |
| 10 | Pagamento | PASS |
| 11 | Foto | PASS |
| 12 | Dashboard | PASS |
| 13 | Logout/login | PASS |

Smoke staging records retained:

- `Cliente Smoke Test`
- `Appartamento Smoke Test`
- `Lavaggio e asciugatura test`
- order `EW-000001`
- one valid order item
- total `25,00 EUR`
- production status `Pronto`
- pickup completed
- delivery completed
- two payments totaling `25,00 EUR`
- balance `0,00 EUR`
- one intake photo

Smoke records remain available on staging for UX and follow-up validation.

## Bugs Resolved During Smoke

- BUG-001 — `create_order` failed because `app_current_organization_id()` used `min(uuid)` and `create_order()` had an ambiguous `id` reference.
- BUG-002 — order list query failed with `PGRST201` because the `profiles` embed was ambiguous.
- BUG-003 — pickup query failed with `PGRST201` because the `profiles` embed was ambiguous.
- BUG-004 — delivery query failed with `PGRST201` because the `profiles` embed was ambiguous.
- BUG-005 — order item creation needed immediate submit locking to reduce repeated-submit risk.
- BUG-006 — order item editing showed too many simultaneous edit forms and save points.

## Unverified or Non-Final Items

- Negative MIME/size upload tests were not executed during smoke.
- Overpayment behavior was not documented with a definitive result.
- Payment actor visibility was not documented with a definitive result.
- `order-media` bucket privacy, file size limit and MIME allowlist were verified read-only during INFRA-001.1.
- Final smoke baseline read-only verification passed during INFRA-001.1.

## Security Notes

- Do not delete the owner Auth user.
- Do not recreate organization, location or membership.
- Do not expose service-role keys in browser code or `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables.
- Do not commit `.env.local`.
- Keep `order-media` private.
- Keep `supabase/.temp/` ignored.
- Do not use Docker unless a new decision explicitly approves it.
- Keep one task per commit.
- Do not modify stable domain logic, routes, migrations or Supabase remote state during RELEASE-001 unless a separate approved implementation task explicitly authorizes it.

## UX-002 Completed State

UX-002 is completed and pushed through `730bcae`.

Completed UX scope:

- localized public access to the protected login from desktop and mobile navigation
- iPhone Safari dev-origin hydration fix through Next.js dev configuration
- protected app shell, sidebar, internal header and mobile bottom navigation refinement
- active navigation states and mobile CTA contrast corrections
- operational dashboard hierarchy and quick actions
- order detail information architecture with clearer section order and sticky internal navigation
- final responsive/accessibility pass for contrast and touch targets

UX-002 did not change database schema, migrations, Supabase remote state, RPCs, Server Actions, workflow logic, pricing, payment logic, logistics logic, photo handling or authentication boundaries.

## Next Approved Task

`RELEASE-001 — Production deployment readiness`

Scope:

- review production target, domain/environment strategy and rollback plan
- verify no service-role key or private credential is browser reachable
- preserve SEC-001 hardening assumptions and PILOT-001 portal authorization boundaries
- do not implement routes, UI, schema, migrations, policy changes or Supabase changes during the review task

PILOT-001 is architecture-approved. The real operational pilot is separate from PILOT-001 and should be tracked later as `PILOT-002` or as the M1 First Laundry Operational Pilot milestone after RELEASE-001, QA-001 and the approved MVP portal implementation tasks.
